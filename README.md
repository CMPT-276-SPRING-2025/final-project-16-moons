## Project Description
A travel application that consolidates all your planning/vacation needs into one convenient place. Provides functionality to create shared calendars to plan vacations with your friends, search for local eateries and find events happening nearby. Eliminates the need to switch between multiple different applications and makes your trip details easy to keep track of and access.
